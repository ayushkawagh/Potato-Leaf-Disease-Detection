Potato Leaf Disease Detection System

This is a deep learning-based system designed to detect diseases in potato leaves using image processing techniques. The system is trained to identify various common potato leaf diseases, helping farmers detect issues early and take necessary actions to prevent crop loss.

Project Overview :-

Potatoes are a major crop worldwide, and diseases can have a significant impact on yield. Traditional methods of disease identification can be time-consuming and prone to error. With the advancement of computer vision and machine learning, this system aims to automate the detection of common potato leaf diseases, such as:
Early Blight
Late Blight
Healthy

The system analyzes images of potato leaves and classifies them into either a healthy category or one of the specific disease categories.

Features:-

Deep Learning Model: Trained on a large dataset of labeled potato leaf images to accurately identify diseases.
Image Classification: Categorizes images of potato leaves into healthy or diseased classes.
Real-time Detection: Capable of real-time disease detection from input images.
User-friendly Interface: Simple-to-use interface for uploading and testing images.

Technologies Used :-

Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
Libraries:
	TensorFlow / Keras for model building and training.
	OpenCV for image preprocessing and manipulation.
	Matplotlib for visualizing training progress.
	Python as the primary programming language.
 
Dataset :-

The dataset used for training consists of images of potato leaves, with labels indicating whether the leaf is healthy or affected by a disease. The dataset was sourced from various publicly available resources such as Kaggle and other agricultural data repositories.
